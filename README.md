### STG: STAYGE Coin
STG is a coin that links the ACT of each community and it serves as the key currency of STAYGE Network. STG can be used in a variety of ways, including transactions between the artists and the operators, trading of goods and services that do not belong to a specific community. It can also be used to join the community activities by exchanging STG with the ACT if there are not enough ACT.

### ACT: Community Activity Token

Fans are rewarded with the ACT for their fan activities such as contents creation, distribution, and the feedback on the artists and the other fans. The ACT issued in one community can only be used in the same community. It allows each community to maintain an independent governance and economic system.
